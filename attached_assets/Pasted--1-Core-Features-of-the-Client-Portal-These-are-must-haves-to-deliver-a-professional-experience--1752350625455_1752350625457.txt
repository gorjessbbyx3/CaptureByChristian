⚙️ 2. Tech Stack Recommendation
Here’s a modern, scalable setup:

📦 Backend:
Framework: FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (Express)

Auth: Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or Magic.link (email magic links)

Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase or PlanetScale (MySQL)

Storage: Firebase Storage, AWS S3, or Uploadcare for photos

🎨 Frontend:
Framework: React (or Next.js for SSR + better SEO)

Styling: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

🔐 3. Authentication & Access Control Workflow
🔁 Workflow:
Client receives invite link after booking or shoot

Auth flow:

Email/password, or

Magic link (click → login)

On login:

Fetch client-specific data (galleries, contracts)

Store token in cookies or localStorage

API requests include token to verify access rights

🖼️ 4. Photo Proofing Workflow
🔁 Workflow:
You upload watermarked proofs via admin dashboard

Client logs in → sees gallery:

Lightbox viewer with like/heart buttons

Optional comments per photo

Client submits favorites (with or without limits)

You get notified → retouch and upload finals

💡 Tip: Use watermark overlay or signed URLs to protect previews.

📥 5. Downloads & Delivery Workflow
🔁 Workflow:
After approval:

Upload high-res versions (maybe zip albums or individual files)

Show download buttons only if:

Payment complete

Selections submitted

Optional:

Watermark-free web-size

Print-size high-res

Share buttons (with expiry)

💡 Pro tip: Use Cloudflare R2 or Uploadcare to limit download bandwidth abuse.

💳 6. Contracts & Payments
🔁 Workflow:
Integrate Stripe or PayPal for payment links

Use PDFFiller API or SignWell for e-signatures

Store signed contract files and receipts in client dashboard
