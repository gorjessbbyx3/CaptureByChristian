📸 Ultimate Photographer CRM – Feature Workflows
🧠 1. Client Relationship Management
Workflow:

New client enters via booking form or manual entry

CRM auto-generates profile with status: Lead

Client interactions (email, bookings, galleries) auto-log in timeline

Tags are added: Wedding, VIP, Repeat, etc.

Client moves through statuses: Lead → Booked → Delivered → Follow-up

📆 2. Integrated Calendar & Scheduling
Workflow:

Photographer sets available time blocks by day or shoot type

Client selects time via booking form

CRM validates availability (based on time, location buffer, blocked dates)

Confirmed bookings populate calendar and session list

Optional: CRM blocks time before/after for prep/travel

📥 3. Lead Capture & Funnel Automation
Workflow:

Site visitor fills inquiry form (name, shoot type, preferred date)

CRM creates a lead profile and tags source (Instagram, website, referral)

Converted leads are moved to Booked, others expire or archive

📝 9. Questionnaires & Forms
Workflow:

Session type (e.g., Wedding) auto-attaches a form template

Client fills out form pre-shoot (pose ideas, timeline, vendor list)

Answers stored in session dashboard

CRM highlights key answers on shoot day (e.g., “Must capture grandma”)

📣 10. Automated Communication Sequences
Workflow:

Booking confirmed → send "Prep Guide" email

2 days before shoot → send reminder + checklist
