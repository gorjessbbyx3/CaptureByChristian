Client Portal Issues That Need Fixing:
1. Gallery Selection Mock Data (client-portal/gallery-viewer.tsx)
Mock selections in existingSelections query:
favorites: ["img_1_3", "img_1_7", "img_1_12"]
comments: {
  "img_1_3": "Love this shot of the ceremony!",
  "img_1_7": "Perfect lighting here"
}
Fix needed: Replace with empty state or real user selections from database
2. Client Dashboard Progress Calculation (client-portal/client-dashboard.tsx)
Hardcoded progress percentages:
const getProgressValue = (status: string) => {
  switch (status) {
    case 'pending': return 25;
    case 'confirmed': return 50;
    case 'in_progress': return 75;
    case 'completed': return 100;
    default: return 0;
  }
};
Fix needed: Calculate progress based on actual workflow stages
3. Missing API Endpoints
/api/client-portal/login - Client authentication
/api/client-portal/magic-link - Magic link generation
/api/client-portal/bookings - Client-specific bookings
/api/client-portal/galleries - Client-specific galleries
/api/client-portal/contracts - Client contracts and invoices
/api/client-portal/selections - Gallery photo selections
/api/client-portal/gallery/{id} - Individual gallery data
4. Placeholder Features
Messages Tab: Shows "Messaging feature coming soon" placeholder
Downloads Tab: Shows "No downloads available yet" placeholder
Magic Link: May not have complete backend verification
Contract Management: Limited contract viewing functionality
5. Mock Client Portal Sessions (admin/client-portal.tsx)
Extensive mock session data with hardcoded:
Client sessions with fake tokens, IP addresses
Mock activity logs and device information
Fake location data and user agents
Fix needed: Replace with real session tracking from database
6. Gallery Image Management
Placeholder images: Uses /api/placeholder/ URLs
Mock watermarks: Hardcoded proof overlays
No real image storage: Missing integration with actual file storage
7. Authentication System
Session management: No real session token validation
User permissions: Missing role-based access control
Security: No proper authentication middleware
8. Real-time Features Missing
Live notifications: No real-time updates for clients
Progress tracking: No live booking status updates
Message threading: No real messaging system
Priority Fixes Needed:
High Priority:

Implement real API endpoints for client portal functions
Replace mock gallery selections with database integration
Add proper authentication and session management
Medium Priority:

Complete messaging system functionality
Implement real download management
Add proper contract viewing/signing
Low Priority:

Replace placeholder images with real gallery management
Add real-time notifications
Enhance security and permissions
The client portal has a solid foundation but needs significant backend integration to become fully functional rather than a demo system.
