Mock Data in Client Portal Components
1. Client Dashboard (client-dashboard.tsx)
Mock Galleries Response: The component fetches real data but has fallback empty states
Progress Calculation: Uses mock status-to-percentage mapping (pending=25%, confirmed=50%, etc.)
Status Color Mapping: Hardcoded color schemes for booking statuses
2. Gallery Viewer (gallery-viewer.tsx)
Mock Selections: In the existingSelections query, returns hardcoded favorites and comments:
favorites: ["img_1_3", "img_1_7", "img_1_12"]
comments: {
  "img_1_3": "Love this shot of the ceremony!",
  "img_1_7": "Perfect lighting here"
}
3. Client Login (client-login.tsx)
Magic Link Simulation: The magic link functionality appears to be implemented but may not have real backend processing
4. Admin Client Portal Management (admin/client-portal.tsx)
Extensive Mock Session Data: Complete mock client portal sessions including:

Mock client sessions with fake IDs, tokens, IP addresses
Simulated user activities (login, gallery_view, download, favorites)
Mock device information (iPhone, MacBook Pro)
Fake location data (Honolulu, HI, Kailua, HI)
Simulated timestamps and user agents
Mock Portal Statistics:

Hardcoded active sessions count
Mock download counts
Fake payment statistics
Simulated activity types
5. Server Routes (server/routes.ts)
Mock Gallery Selections API: The selections endpoints return and accept mock data:
selections = {
  galleryId,
  clientId,
  favorites: ["img_1_3", "img_1_7", "img_1_12"],
  comments: { ... }
}
Mock Gallery Data: Gallery endpoints may return mock image data
Mock Client Authentication: Login endpoints may have simplified mock authentication
6. General Mock Features
Placeholder Images: Uses /api/placeholder/ URLs for gallery covers
Demo Watermarks: Proof galleries show "© Christian Picaso Photography • PROOF" overlays
Mock Download Counts: Gallery cards show mock photo counts
Simulated Progress Bars: Booking progress uses hardcoded percentage calculations
7. Missing Real Integrations
Messages Tab: Shows "Messaging feature coming soon" placeholder
Downloads Tab: Shows "No downloads available yet" placeholder
Magic Link Verification: May not have complete backend verification
Real Image Storage: May be using placeholder images instead of real file storage
The client portal appears to be a functional demo with significant mock data, particularly in the admin monitoring section and gallery selection functionality. The core structure is there, but much of the data and some features are simulated rather than fully integrated with real backend services.
