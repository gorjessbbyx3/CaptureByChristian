Missing API Endpoints Needed:
/api/invoices/stats - Real payment tracking
/api/products - Product catalog management
/api/questionnaires - Form creation and management
/api/ai/insights - Real AI business analysis
/api/predictions - Actual predictive analytics
/api/analytics/clients - Real client metrics

These components show impressive mock functionality but need real database integration and API endpoints to become fully functional business tools.
