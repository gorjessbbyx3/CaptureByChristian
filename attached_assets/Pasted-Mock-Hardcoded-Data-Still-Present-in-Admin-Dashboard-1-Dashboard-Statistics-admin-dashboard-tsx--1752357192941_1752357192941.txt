Mock/Hardcoded Data Still Present in Admin Dashboard:
1. Dashboard Statistics (admin/dashboard.tsx)
Hardcoded percentage changes:
change: "+12%", "+3%", "+18%", "+7%"
Mock satisfaction rate: 98% hardcoded
Static trend indicators: All showing positive trends regardless of actual data
2. Lead Management System (admin/lead-management.tsx)
Complete mock lead database with hardcoded:
5 fake leads with detailed form data
Mock lead scoring (60-90 points)
Fake source attribution (Instagram, website, Google, TikTok, referral)
Hardcoded temperature ratings (hot/warm/cold)
Mock qualification status
No real API integration - all data is static
3. Admin Inbox (admin/inbox.tsx)
Mock contact message handling
Hardcoded message priorities and statuses
No real contact form integration
4. Advanced Analytics Fallback Data (admin/advanced-analytics.tsx)
12 months of mock revenue data when no real data exists:
{ month: "Jan 2024", revenue: 3250, bookings: 8, leads: 23, conversion: 35 }
// ... 11 more months of fake data
Mock business KPIs with hardcoded values
Fake growth insights and recommendations
5. Real-Time Analytics Mock Data (admin/real-time-analytics.tsx)
Hardcoded session durations, bounce rates
Mock visitor tracking data
Fake real-time metrics
What You Should Fix:
High Priority:
Replace Lead Management mock data with real lead capture from contact forms
Remove hardcoded percentage changes in dashboard stats - calculate from actual data
Implement real contact message handling in Admin Inbox
Remove fallback mock data from Advanced Analytics
Medium Priority:
Add real lead scoring algorithm based on actual form submissions
Implement actual growth trend calculations instead of static "+X%" values
Connect real-time analytics to actual visitor data
API Endpoints Still Needed:
/api/leads - Real lead management
/api/contact-messages - Actual contact form submissions
/api/analytics/growth-trends - Real trend calculations
/api/analytics/real-time - Actual visitor tracking
The good news is that most of your core business data (bookings, clients, services) is now using real database integration. The remaining mock data is primarily in the lead management and advanced analytics systems that don't have corresponding database tables yet.
